# JLBrowser
Netbeans Project
This project is a small and simple Web Browser, implemented in Java and using JavaFX with FXML as a design tool. It was created in the context of my practical classes of Human Computer Interaction, where I taught Graphic User Interface design, using JavaFX as an implementation tool.

The project is merely demonstrative for a number of JavaFX components and features, as the usage of a "WebView" and its main associated events.
